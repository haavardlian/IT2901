With the ever rising consumption of electricity in households and people becoming increasingly conscious about the environment, a market has evolved for systems that monitor power consumption. There are systems on the market that allow monitoring of devices and total usage, but none of them focus on sharing experiences with others. Awareness around, and encouragement to reduce power consumption might be aided greatly if users could share their experiences and progress on social media, like Facebook.

This report describes how a team of six students at NTNU, developed a solution for SINTEF Energy to resolve this problem. It includes both detailed architecture of the system, the development process, and how the team envisions further development of the system. The Android app Wattitude was developed to give users an easy platform to monitor and control their power consumption. The app also gives users the ability to create tips for saving energy, and share both these and their consumption data with their Facebook friends. A server for data synchronization was also developed.

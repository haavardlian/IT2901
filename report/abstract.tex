\begin{abstract}
With the ever rising consumption of electricity in households and people being concious about the environment, a market has sprung up for systems that monitor electrical consumption. There are systems on the market that allow monitoring of devices and total usage, but none of them focus on sharing experiences with others. Awareness around, and encouragement to reduce power consumption might be aided greatly if users could share their experiences and progress on social media like Facebook.

This report aims to show how a team of six students at NTNU for Sintef in Trondheim tried to provide a solution for this problem. It includes both detailed architecture of the system, how progress was made and how the team envisions the further development of the system. The Android app Wattitude was developed to give users an easy platform to monitor and control their power consumption on. The app would also give users the possibility to create tips for saving energy, and share both this and their consumption data with their Facebook friends. A server for data synchronization was also developed. This would let the app user compare and share his usage, even if he were to reinstall the application.

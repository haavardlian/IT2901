\section{Design}
To familiarize ourselves with the context of our application, the team did a lot of research in the beginning of the project, as described in the prestudy\todo{add reference}. A part of that process was to find already existing solutions and hopefully get some ideas about what functionality that might be useful in our application, but also regarding the graphical user interface design.

As mentioned in \todo{add ref} existing solutions, the team did find some design solutions we were inspired by.

This section summarizes the team's process of designing the application layout.

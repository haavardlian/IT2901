\section{Designing the graphical user interface}
To familiarize ourselves with the context of our application, the team did a lot of research in the beginning of the project, as described in chapter~\ref{sec:prestudy}. A part of that process was to find already existing solutions and hopefully get some ideas about what functionality that might be useful in our application, but also regarding the graphical user interface design.

This section summarizes the team's process of designing the graphical user interface for the app.

\subsection{Branding}
An important part of the design process was to make sure the app was both user friendly and well customized for its purpose. As it did not really exist a pack of icons that suited all of our needs, the team created custom icons for the different tabs and devices so that the functions within each tab would become more clear for the user.

The team also decided to change the name of the app, originally named ''UbiSolar''. We came to the conclusion that, considering that the purpose of the app was to increase the awareness of power consumption, the app should have a name that reflected this purpose. Hence, we had a brainstorming session, which lead to the name ''Wattitude'', a composition of watt and attitude (towards power consumption), an idea that was well received by the customer.

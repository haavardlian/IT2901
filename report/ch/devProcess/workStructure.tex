\section{Sprint overview}


\subsection{Excessive discussion}
The team has seen that much time is being spent discussing a lot. The discussion are of importance, but it drains too much of the time the team members has. As to this, it has been decided that there should be set a certain amount of time for the discussions. Should the discussions last longer than the time set, the project leader's task was to focus on ending the discussions, and instead perform a democratic vote based on the arguments that were presented.

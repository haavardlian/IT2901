\section{Scrum tools}
\label{sec:improperScrum}
As mentioned in section~\ref{sec:scrumtool}, the team used a lot of time on
deciding on which Scrum tool to use for the project management. Although our
choice fell on Yodiz, the team was in lack of any previous experience with the
tool, and despite the team's efforts to get acquainted with the tool, a
misunderstanding arose and was not discovered until the end of the second
sprint.

The misunderstanding, displayed in figure~\ref{fig:wrongUse}, was that the team
assumed one could add multiple individuals as responsible on a particular task,
while Yodiz' functionality only assigned the time spent to the individual that
either created the task or was assigned as owner of the task.

As a result, it appeared as if only singular individuals performed the tasks,
even though the entire team in reality was participating, which was also
reflected in the burndown charts and the generated gantt diagram. 

To sort out this issue, the team went through old meeting reports and timesheets
to figure out which members of the team that had actually participated on the
particular task, and added new tasks and the time spent to the members that at
the time had not recorded this information, as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:addsTasks}.

This issue was unfortunate, but not insurmountable, and also not a critical
issue for the overall progress of the project.

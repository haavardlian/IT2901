\subsection{Kickoff}
In the very beginning, right after the team was assigned to this project, an initial meeting was conducted. All of the group members knew each other beforehand. During this meeting it was discussed which times that was best suited to have weekly meetings. The team also discussed and clarified expectations to this project. All team members agreed to aim for the character A.

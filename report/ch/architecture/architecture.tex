\chapter{System architecture}

A considerable amount of the project consisted of the actual implementation of the app the team was to deliver to the customer at the end of the semester. 

This chapter provides a detailed description of the app architecture and database structure, and how it was implemented. It also describes how and why said architecture was chosen, and what patterns that were followed in the implementation.

\section{Server architecture}
\label{sec:arch_server}
The server is the system back-end and is responsible for permanently storing data and providing it to the user on demand. The team decided that the server should be RESTful in order to make it easy to access. The data-interchange format chosen to transfer data between the app and the server is JSON. This format was chosen for its human readability and it is easily parsed by computer software. In addition, both these properties allow for easy integration with future functionality.

\subsection{Dropwizard}
The server is implemented in Dropwizard which is a Java framework for making RESTful web services. The main class of the server is a service that provides access to the database at runtime. The main structure of how the server uses resources and the database can be found in figure~\ref{fig:classDiagramServer}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Resources}
A Dropwizard implementation has a set of resource classes. These classes contain methods that map to a URI path. When the server receives a ~\gls{HTTP} request it will try to match the path to the paths defined by the resource methods. Then it will call the method found or return a ''not found'' error. An example resource class is included in code snippet~\ref{lst:dropwizardResource}. The method in this resource will handle HTTP GET calls to ''/user/\{user\}/sync/usage/\{timestamp\}'' where \{user\} and \{timestamp\} matches any text. These variables is then used inside the method to perform actions depending on user and timestamp.

@Path("user/{user}/sync")
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public class SyncResource {
    @GET
    @Path("/usage/{timestamp}")
    public List<DeviceUsage> getUpdatedUsage(
	   @PathParam("timestamp") LongParam timestamp, 
	   @PathParam("user") LongParam userId) {
        List<DeviceUsage> usage = db.getUpdatedUsage(
		       userId.get(), timestamp.get());
        if(usage != null && !usage.isEmpty())
            return usage;
        else
            throw new WebApplicationException(
			         Response.Status.NO_CONTENT);
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\subsubsection{Database abstraction}
Dropwizard uses the JDBC and JDBI libraries to communicate with the database. The JDBC library is Java's standard interface to databases. MySQL provides a driver for JDBC in order to make communication possible. JDBI is a convenience layer on top of JDBC which makes it possible to write an interface with SQL queries and use that interface as a ~\gls{DAO}.

\subsection{Database}
For permanent storage the server uses MySQL. MySQL is a reliable and easy to set up database. A diagram of how the database is designed can be found in figure~\ref{fig:ER-Diagram}

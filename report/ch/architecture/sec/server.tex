\section{Server architecture}
The server consists of two parts. One for handling requests from the Android app and one for storing data that is collected in the users home. 
The part that handles the Android app runs Dropwizard, which is a collection of Java libraries that together constitutes a REST service. 

These libraries include Jetty, Jersey, JDBC, and Jackson. These are discussed in further detail in section~\ref{sec:libraries}. The server exposes a set of URLs that provided the Android app with the ability to retrieve and store data from the database. The part of the system that would aggregate collected data from a aggregation server in the users home is not implemented. More on this in modularity~\ref{sec:modularity} and the further developement chapter~\ref{sec:further}.

\section{Architectural design decisions}
Choosing an architecture is probably the most influential decision in any software development project. To make a more informed decision with regards to the architecture, the team conducted a preliminary study, which resulted in a detailed plan on how the different components would interact. 

Most of the team members had little experience with developing a server according to the chosen design. Development and design were therefore done interchangeably and iteratively in the early stages of the project. Changes in the architectual design was also done because, as mentioned in chapter~\ref{sec:recSpecification}, many of the requirements in the first requirements specification was discarded due to time constraints.

The team emphasized that the server should be simple and fast, which is ideal for the stateless design that was ultimately chosen. Further details on system qualities may be found in the subsequent sections.

\section{Architectural design decisions}
Selecting an architecture is one of the most influential decision in any software development project. To be able to make better decisions, the team conducted a preliminary study and created a detailed plan on how the different components would interact. 

The team members had little to no experience with developing a server according to the chosen design. Development and design were therefore done interchangeably and iteratively in the early stages of the project. Changes in the architectural design was also done because, as mentioned in chapter~\ref{sec:recSpecification}, many of the requirements in the first requirements specification was discarded due to time constraints.

The team emphasized that the server should be simple and fast, which is ideal for the stateless design that was ultimately chosen.

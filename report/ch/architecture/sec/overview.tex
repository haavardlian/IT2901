The system has a client-server architecture with an Android client, and a central server. An overview of the architectural components is given in figure~\ref{fig:architecture}. This outline shows the primary components of the final solution. The Android app communicates with the central server through the Internet. The server handles functionality for managing and storing data in a database.

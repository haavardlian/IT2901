\section{Scrum}

The assignment at hand will demand innovation and frequent changes underways.
What the group needs is an agile development framework to follow. First and foremost it must also be a development framework that is know to the group so no time will be spent trying to learn a new process. 
The standard choice for this is to follow the Scrum model. All the members of the group have previous experience with this from the course IT1901.

The Scrum model is made as an iterative and incremental agile software development framework.
The main principle is that a small group is focusing on reaching a common goal.

The scrum process consists of intervals of sprints that are 1 to 4 weeks long. Each sprint has three important parts.
The first part is the sprint planning meeting, then begins the daily scrum meetings and the process is ended with a so called end meeting.

\subsection{Sprint planning}
Then the sprint planning begins. The objective of the sprint planning is to find out what work to be done and prepare a
sprint backlog that consists of the tasks to be done and how much time the team thinks it will take to complete it.

\subsection{Daily meetings}


\subsection{End meeting}
that consists of  a sprint review and retrospective meeting for the last sprint.
Thus progress is reviewed and accumulated lessons from the sprint can be taken in account for the next sprint.


\subsection{Our process}
We have chosen to have sprint that are two weeks long. Having daily meetings is not possible with our schedule,
since this course demands 20 hours each week and the team members is taking different courses besides this one.
Thus we have ended up with having two meetings each week that begins with a ‘daily meeting’.

We have also decided to use a Scrum tool to help us in the process.
It will give us automatic sprint backlogs and time measurements for each group, and graphs. Lots of graphs.

Out team has previously had experience with scrum tools like icescrum. This experience was not a jolly one.
Thus a search for a better tool was done. The tool of choice ended up being Yodiz.

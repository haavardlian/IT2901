\subsection{Risk analysis}
As part of our project planning, we have outlined potential risks to the progress of our work. A risk
is defined as an unwanted event that affects the process. We acknowledge the possibility of challenges and problems arising during the work, such as technical problems, human error or personal problems. These are risks for both individuals and the group as a whole. Effects of these problems include delays, conflict and anything that will slow the progress, and ultimately lead to the failure of meeting deadlines. One of the most prevalent and dangerous risks is loss of motivation from one or more members of the group. Our assessment of the risks to this project is included in attachment E. The risk elements are sorted by their importance. Importance is calculated with two factors in mind; the calculated probability of the event actually occurring and the effect the event will have on the project. 

In the table given below, we analyze the elements we consider risks to our project. Probability (P) and effect (E) is measured on a scale from 1 to 9. For probability, a 9 is very likely and a 1 is very unlikely. For effect, a 9 is devastating and a 1 is not much effect. The table is sorted from high to low importance (I). Importance is the product of probability and effect.

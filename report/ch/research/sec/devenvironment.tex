\section{Development tools and libraries}

The team members have decided to use the  integrated development environments Eclipse and IntelliJ, which is well integrated with Android. 

All the team members already had experience with Eclipse, but some of us also wanted to try out IntelliJ, as it appeared to have more features, such as a faster compiler, better search function and autocompletion of code, than Eclipse. However, the remaining part of the team considered the learning curve to switch to IntelliJ to be greater than the advantages and therefore chose to stick to Eclipse.

\section{Existing solutions}

Based on the product requirements we have worked out, we did some research on existing products in the same market and compiled a list over the most relevant products, possibly competing with our product. This list contains a brief overview of the functionalities and drawbacks of the existing products. We also used this study in alternative solutions as an inspiration for functionality and features we can use in our product.

\subsection{Smartly}

Smartly\cite{smartly} is an application that allows the user to monitor and control things like temperature and lighting in the house. It has an overview over total power consumption but not much more. Since we want to be able to measure the power usage in each device, this is not that similar to our project. 


\subsection{NTE miniSolo energydisplay}

The NTE miniSolo energydisplay\cite{nte} is a product measures the total power usage real time and allows the user to power off devices to see the effect on the total power consumption. It has some interesting features like detailed power consumption and a relation to how much money the power usage amounts to. These are features we also want to have in our application. The miniSolo energydisplay is however linked to a proprietary device and has no Android application.



\subsection{Theowl}

Theowl\cite{theowl} is a product that mainly focuses on temperature control. It lacks many of the features we want but it has an interesting architecture with remote sensors that sends precise data and allow the user to control certain devices. This product has no official support in Norway and the product is a bit expensive.


\subsection{OpenEnergyMonitor}

OpenEnergyMonitor\cite{openenergymonitor} is an open source project that allows data collection from power outages. Some of the architecture for collecting data can be an interesting option to consider if improved. The project is open source, and the architecture is somewhat similar to what we imagine using in our project. But with the OpenEnergyMonitor you now have to manually go around your house to collect the data. It is also somewhat hard to set up - so itâ€™s not very user friendly for the average consumer.  This product also has an application for processing, logging and visualizing energy usage. This is features we also want in our product. 



\subsection{Efergy}

Efergy\cite{efergy} is the product closest to the one the team want to develop. It has nice visual representation of data, is economical comparable, and social integration. The architecture in this product is very interesting as it has support for measuring the power usage of single devices over wireless radio, that communicates with a local receiver. The receiver is connected to a server through the users Internet. What Efergy lacks is the ability to monitor and control private power production and it is somewhat expensive.

The customer's main focus was to raise awareness about energy consumption. To develop an app for this purpose, the team needed a deeper insight in how to measure power consumption in private households and what similar solutions that already existed on the market.

To learn more about power consumption and how to reduce it, the team contacted electrical power providers. Their strategies to raise awareness included campaigns, which was not relevant for our purpose, and providing tips to the consumers. It was concluded that the app should provide users with tips to reduce electricity usage. To further engage the user, the app should include the ability to add tips to a personal check list, and let the user check off tips when they have been performed.

Another field of research was hardware the team could use to measure power consumption in real time. Before the preliminary work was carried out, the customer emphasized features that would distinguish the app from the similar solutions on the market. By allowing the app to control individual devices like light bulbs and heaters, and measure the power consumption automatically, the app could potentially become a unique segment of the market. This functionality was dropped due to time constraints, but the app was developed with future integration of said functionality in mind. More details on this in chapter~\ref{sec:further}, along with more about how the team envisions further development.

\section{Domain knowledge}
The customer's main focus was to raise awareness about energy consumption. To develop an app for this purpose, the team needed a deeper insight in how to measure power consumption in private households and what similar solutions that already existed on the market.

To learn more about power consumption and how to reduce electricity usage, the team contacted electrical power providers. Their strategies to raise awareness included campaigns, which was not relevant for our purpose, and sharing tips with the consumers. It was concluded that the app should provide users with tips to reduce electricity usage, and arouse their involvement by letting them share these tips on Facebook, rate them and add new tips. To further wake the competetive instincts, the app should also include the ability to add tips to a personal check list, and let the user continuously check off tips when they had been performed.

Another field that was researched was hardware the team potentially could use to measure power consumption in real time. Before the preliminiary work was carried out, the customer emphasized features that would distinguish the app from the numerous similar solutions already on the market. By allowing the app to control individual devices like light bulbs and heaters while the consumption automatically was measured, the app could potentially become a unique segment of the market. Although the team later had to drop this functionality due to time constraints, it was agreed that the app should be developed so that integration would be easier to conduct in the future. More details on this in chapter~\ref{sec:further}, along with more about how the team envisions further development.

\subsection{Libraries}
\label{sec:libraries}
Libraries are pieces of code that are integrated into the project. They provide functionality needed and save time by reducing the workload. The libraries used and what they were used for is displayed in table~\ref{tab:libs}.
%When utilizing libraries, it is important to make sure the licenses match the project and the customer's request.
 All libraries used fall under the Apache 2.0 license~\cite{apache}.

\textbf{Library }& \textbf{What it is used for}\\\hline
Jersey/JAX-RS~\cite{jersey} & Provides the Representational State Transfer(REST) service of our server.\\\hline
Jackson~\cite{jackson}&Translates data to \gls{JSON} before it is sent to the client.\\\hline
Jetty~\cite{jetty}&Is a HTTP server.\\\hline
JDBI~\cite{jdbi}&Exposes relational databases and makes them more modular and flexible.\\\hline
Volley~\cite{volley}& Handles network requests on the Android device.\\\hline
aChartEngine~\cite{achart}& Displays detailed power usage data through pie charts and line charts.\\\hline
PagerSlidingTabStrip~\cite{psts}& Creates tabs for easy swapping between views.\\\hline
ProgressFragment~\cite{progressfragment}& Makes it easy to show that a Fragment is loading the view.\\\hline
android-segmented-control~\cite{segments}& Segment view for swapping between data resolutions.\\\hline
android-spinnerwheel\cite{spinnerwheel}& Spinner wheel for date selection.\\\hline

\subsubsection{Dropwizard}
Dropwizard~\cite{dropwizard} is a lightweight collection of tools used to set up and host a server. Dropwizard is a relatively new framework, but the tools in the collection are popular and well maintained. 
The advantages of using Dropwizard instead of using the tools by themselves is that everything is configured to work well together. The most notable components of Dropwizard are Jetty, Jackson, Jersey, and JDBI.

\subsubsection{Facebook SDK}
The Facebook SDK~\cite{fsdk} is a collection of functions that allows Facebook's functionality to be integrated into the app. The key functionality for this project, provided by the SDK, is the possibility for the user to log in on their Facebook account.

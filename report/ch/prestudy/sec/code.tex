\subsection{Code management and versioning}
\subsubsection{GitHub}
The team decided to use Git with GitHub~\cite{github} instead of alternative tools like SVN~\cite{svn} and Mercurial~\cite{mercurial}, because most of us had extensive experience with Git from previous projects. It was also requested by the customer. 

In addition to this, Git offers very good support for team development with advanced functionality like branching and version control to make contributions from several developers easy to manage. GitHub also works as an external backup for the project and some of the documentation, making data loss less likely to occur.

\subsubsection{Development in Android}
For the development in Android, the team used Android Studio~\cite{android-studio}, which is an integrated development environment based on IntelliJ~\cite{intellij}, that is specifically designed for development on the Android platform.

\subsubsection{Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)}
The main IDEs for Java programming are Eclipse~\cite{eclipse}, NetBeans~\cite{netbeans} and IntelliJ. Most of the team members has experience with Eclipse for both Java and Android development, but Android Studio was chosen because of Googles decision to start moving towards Gradle and Android Studio.

The team decided to keep the back-end part optional. All the IDEs have tools for checking the code quality and code conventions, and compatibility between them was only a minor issue that could be resolved with Git.

\subsubsection{Maven}
Maven~\cite{maven} is an intelligent project management, construction and application tool, that can be used to build and manage Java-based projects. The goal of Maven is to give developers an understanding of the complete state of a development project in the shortest amount of time.

\subsubsection{Gradle}
Gradle~\cite{gradle} is in many ways similar to Maven. It is used to build and manage the Android part of the project. The reason we use Gradle instead of Maven for the entire project is because Gradle is well integrated with the Android environment and most of the libraries needed for the Android app is supported through Gradle.

\subsubsection{Code convention}
This project uses Java~\cite{javaconv} and Android's code conventions~\cite{androidconv}, as requested by the customer.

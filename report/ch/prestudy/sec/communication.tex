\subsection{Communication}
\subsubsection{Google groups}
The team chose Google groups~\cite{ggroups} as an arena for casual communication. Google groups includes a shared e-mail-list, ensuring that none of the team members unintentionally gets left out of the information stream. E-mail has the advantage of being an asynchronous communication, which well fitted the team's purposes. The team mainly used this e-mail-list to communicate between the meetings and to share information that was urgent or came from external sources. 

\subsubsection{E-mail}
The team has primarily used e-mail as communication protocol when in dialog with the customer and our supervisor.

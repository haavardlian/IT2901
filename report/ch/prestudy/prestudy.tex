\chapter{Preliminary work}

\label{sec:prestudy}
The object of this chapter is to clarify the first phase of the project, which involved a lot of planning and research. 

In this chapter, we have a closer look at the domain knowledge the team had to acquire before undertaking the project. We also explore similar and existing solutions that already were available on the market, review both their advantages and drawbacks, and lastly compare the different solutions on what we considered to be important features. Here, an overview of the different technologies used to support the development of the app is also to be found.

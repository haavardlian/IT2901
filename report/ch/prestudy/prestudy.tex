\chapter{Prestudy}

The object of this chapter is to clarify the first phase of the project, which involved a lot of planning and research. The team found this was necessary in order to get an overview of the hours available, what tasks that needed to be done and the risks that might occur during the project.

The first part of the chapter consists of a work breakdown structure, giving an overview of which tasks the project consists of. The second part consists of a Gantt diagram, which briefly explains the time line of the project's progress. The last part consists of a risk analysis and a thorough explanation on the thought behind each of them.

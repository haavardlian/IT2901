\chapter{Development environment}

The object of this is to give a brief introduction to which technologies and tools the team used as an aid in the development process.

The team decided, in conjunction with the customer, which technologies to use for the collaboration of code, including which code conventions and design guidelines to follow. 

This chapter describes the tools and libraries that were used as aid in the development of the code, what code convention we practiced, which tools we used for our collaboration on the documentation and our main channels of communication.

The team has chosen Google groups as an arena for casual communication. Google groups also includes a shared e-mail-list, ensuring that none of the team members unintentionally gets left out of the information stream.  E-mail has the advantage of being an asynchronous communication for, well fitted for the team's purposes. The team mainly use this e-mail-list to communicate between the meetings and to share information that is urgent or from external sources.  Here, the team may casually communicate, and discuss problems and solutions during the development process.

Google groups includes a shared e-mail-list, ensuring that none of the team members unintentionally gets left out of the information stream. E-mail has the advantage of being an asynchronous communication, well fitted for the team's purposes. The team mainly use this e-mail-list to communicate between the meetings and to share information that is urgent or from external sources.

\section{Documentation}

\subsection{Google Drive}
The team has decided use Google Drive for most of the temporary documentation because it offers an easy way to create documents that is accessible for editing and collaboration simultaneously for the entire team. Here, the team will mainly 
keep documents like meeting agendas, information gathering, input from the customer and the supervisor, product concepts and other documents waiting to get put into the final report. 

In addition, Google Drive serves as an external backup, making it highly unlikely that important documentation will be lost. 


\subsection{\LaTeX}
LaTeX is an advanced typesetting system for document production, widely used in
academic institutions. The system focuses on allowing the author to focus mainly on the content of the document, and less on the design and document layout.

The team has chosen LaTeX for the final report instead of other word processing programs like Microsoft Office or Google Drive, because LaTeX makes it easier to keep track of references and to maintain the appearance of large
documents. 

In addition, LaTeX provides the ability to break documents into smaller parts and for several team members to simultaneously make changes to the report.


\subsection{JavaDoc}
The team will use JavaDoc~\cite{javadoc} to document the code. The main advantages of using JavaDoc is that it can be integrated with the Java code and linked directly with classes and methods making it easier for others to use the code.

\subsection{Yodiz}
The team's main requirements in a Scrum tool is that it easy to use and effective for project management, has Git integration, and that can create charts for documentation purposes. With this tool the team should be able to get an overview over the projects progress and the team's performance. 

The team chose Yodiz over other Scrum tools because it provides 
free accounts for educational purposes and it suited the team's requirements.

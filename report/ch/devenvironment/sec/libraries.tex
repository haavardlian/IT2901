\subsection{Dropwizard}
Dropwizard~\cite{dropwizard} is a lightweight collection of tools used to set up and host a server. Dropwizard itself is new and not much used yet, but the tools in the collection are popular and well maintained. The advantages of using Dropwizard instead of using the tools by themselves is that everything is configured to work together and it synergizes well.
Dropwizard and all its parts is under the apache 2.0 licence~\cite{apache20}. 

\subsubsection{Jersey/JAX-RS}
Jersey provides the REST(Representational State Transfer) service of our server. REST is the API(Application Programming Interface) that provides programmers with an interface to communicate with the server through basic HTTP commandos like GET, POST, PUT and UPDATE. For the application communication will be done using the JSON format described under jackson~\cite{jackson}.

\subsubsection{Jackson}
Jackson is the tooled used to translate data to JSON before itâ€™s sent to the client. JSON is used as a textual representation of the objects and is a standard way to store and transfer data between different components.

\subsubsection{Jetty}
Jetty is an integrated HTTP server that allows the server application to run by itself without the need for any  complicated and bloated web service like apache or tomcat. This makes setting up and running the server application more user friendly and faster.

\subsubsection{JDBI}
JDBI is a library that exposes relational databases and makes them more modular and flexible. This library removes many of the problems related to database usage and communication.

\subsection{Volley}
Volley is a library that will handle network requests on the android device. It is a easy-to-use, lightweight library that makes communicating with the server simpler and more error proof.  Volley is made and maintained by Google and is licensed under apache 2.0.

\subsection{aChartEngine}
aChartEngine~\cite{achartengine} is a popular android library for creating graphs. In the project this library will mainly be used for line graphs, for displaying detailed power usage data, and pie charts for comparing power consumption between devices. This library is licensed under apache 2.0~\cite{apache20}

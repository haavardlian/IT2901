\section{Miscellaneous issues}
The following sections represent the remaining challenges that was encountered, and how these challenges were solved.

\subsection{Unplanned absence}
One of the team members, Lars Erik, had to make a sudden trip abroad due to a death in the family. He was away from the team for a total of twelve days. Prior to departure the team assigned Lars
Erik with lighter workload, in accordance with the risk(7) in table ~\ref{tab:risktable}. Even with the redistributed workload, the team, and Lars Erik in particular, found the distance and time difference to
be a bigger problem than expected. Some work was left undone and had to be picked up at the end of the sprint or pushed to the next sprint. The team learned that the impact of such leaves of absence should probably be overestimated rather than underestimated in the eventuality of another event.

\subsection{Workplace issues}
The team had booked meeting rooms three times a week in NTNU's IT building to host the work sessions. Unfortunately, the building was under renovation for the entire duration of the project. Booking other rooms that fit the teams needs so late in the semester proved to be difficult. This issue led to periods where the team were disturbed a lot by construction, which in turn lead to team members growing tired and being a bit more on edge than usual. To counter this, the team instated a cake policy. Every Wednesday a team member would bring something good to eat as well as making sure that the other team members took regular breaks. This helped ease the tension of the work sessions.

\subsection{Traveling to China}
In the beginning of April the entire team left for a school trip to China. This meant that the team would be unavailable for a total of 17 days, including weekends and the Easter holidays. The team decided to not expect that any work would be done during the trip. The team increased the number of work hours from 20 to 25 per week as described in section~\ref{sec:availableHours}.
Had the team not traveled to China, the project would have had 9 sprints worth a total of 2160 hours to spend on the project. The team's attempt to compensate for the school trip left the team with 8 sprints, giving a total of 2340 working hours, as shown in table~\ref{tab:availHours}. This means that the team projected a usage of 180 hours more than the course required.

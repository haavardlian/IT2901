\section{Allocation of time and resources}
\label{sec:timeSpent}
This section presents an overview of the time and resource allocation in the project.

\subsection{Time allocation}
At the beginning of the project, the team did an estimation on how much time would be spent on each part of the project. In figure~\ref{fig:piechart} the result of this estimation is shown.

When comparing the actual time spent with the estimated time from table~\ref{tab:timeEstWP}, it is clear that the team spent more time on \todo{add more here when illustrations are ready. Sprint 8 on release chart is estimated time used.}

\end{figure}

\noindent In the release burn down chart, displayed in figure~\ref{fig:release}, the estimated project progress is compared with the progress that was actually made. As the graph shows, the team worked less than the estimated number of hours. There are several reasons for this, including unplanned absence of team members, underestimation of tasks and too heavy workload due to deliveries in other classes. 

Another large factor in the discrepancy between the planned hours and the actual time spent is the manner of which work hours are logged. The hours logged in Yodiz, shown in figure~\ref{fig:release}, only represent how long specific tasks took to complete. The logging done in Yodiz is used primarily to estimate user stories and tasks, and not to log precise work hours. This gives a deviation in hours spent and hours logged, which in time amounts to a notable amount. Fortunately, the team had deliberately overestimated the number of work hours to compensate for lost time due to the school trip to China. This action resulted in that the team was still able to fulfill the course requirement and complete the assignment within the project's time scope.

\subsection{Resource allocation}
As described in section~\ref{sec:availResources}, the team had several resources available, including a supervisor, and the customer. The team had internal meetings at least two times a week, and also an eight hour work session once a week. In addition, weekly meetings with the customer and meetings with the supervisor every other week were held.

To have meetings on such a regular basis has been of great value for the team. It saved a lot of time to have pre-booked meeting rooms, and it was also easier for the other parties involved in the project to prepare for the meetings.

During the meetings with the supervisor, the team were given valuable input and feedback regarding customer relations, and the content and structure of the report. Although the role of the supervisor was unclear to the team in the early stages of the project. It was quickly learned that he was more a guide the team could use for help, and not a supervisor that was in place to make sure work was being done. The only real oversight the supervisor had was the activity report which included a work log and a summary of the progress made since the last meeting.

Communicating with the customer on a regular basis reduced the probability of misunderstandings arising and increased the likelihood that the team would deliver a product the customer would be greatly satisfied with. 

One of the most valuable decisions that was made in this project was to actually have fixed meeting times. This assured that the entire team was kept updated and involved. On these internal meetings, the team planned and distributed tasks among the team members, and discussed occurring issues. Each team member was assigned an area of responsibility, so that no important parts of the project would be neglected. It also turned out to be a way to keep the motivation high and further involve the team members.

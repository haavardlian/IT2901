\section{Product evaluation}
All parts of the process have been discussed, and it is now time to review the quality of the finished product. Considering all factors discussed so far in this chapter, the team was content with the final product. The finished product consist of the Android app, the server and documentation for both, and lastly this report. As with most projects though, the team wishes it had accomplished more of its goals. There is some functionality the team would have like to completed given different circumstances. The team would also like to one day see the app  fully developed with hardware components that allow for automatic measurement and control, but we were comfortable admitting this was out of reach within the bounds of this project. 

The customer was very pleased with the finished product. As mentioned many times before, the team cooperated very closely with the customer, and therefore the customer knew pretty accurately which state the project would be in at product delivery. The customer wants to integrate our project in the work the Sintef group has already done for the Cossmic project. The customer also gave the team motivation towards commercializing the app. A customer approval letter was given by the customer to include in this report. This can be found in~\ref{sec:recommandation}

\section{Product evaluation}
Considering all factors discussed so far in this chapter, the team was content with the final product. The finished product consists of the Android app, the server and documentation for both, and lastly this report. 

As with most projects, the team wishes it had accomplished more of its goals. There is some functionality the team would have liked to complete given different circumstances. The team would like to one day see the app fully developed with hardware components that allow automatic measurement and control.

The customer, and the team were pleased with the finished product. The customer wants to integrate the project in the work the SINTEF team has already done for the CoSSMic project. The customer encouraged the team to commercialize the product. A customer approval letter was given by the customer to include in this report. This can be found in appendix~\ref{sec:recommendation}.

The last contact with the customer was done as a presentation to SINTEF Energy and the people working at CoSSMic. After presenting the product, the team had a more in depth discussion with the CoSSMic team on how they had solved the different issues related to creating the entire solution.

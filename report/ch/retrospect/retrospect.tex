\chapter{Retrospect}
In this chapter, the objective is to evaluate all of the choices the team has made during this course. This includes the time spent, the entire development process - from choosing IDEs to testing the system and the project management. 

\section{Time spent and resource use}
SECTION NOT FINISHED. Here we are to write about what we think about following the wbs to structure our time. Was all the time spent with the supervisor and the customer optimal? Did we need all the resources given to us? Student assistant, group meetings with the class. Did we get the most out of our own group meetings or could we have done something different?
In the beginning, the team found the supervisors role somewhat confusing. After one or two meeting, and explicit asking the supervisor it became more clear to us that the supervisor was an overall support with focus on our report. 

\section{Development process}
SECTION NOT FINISHED. For this process, the team chose to use scrum together with extreme programming. (Did we add extreme programming after a little while? Should this be mentioned?) Even though all of the team members have previous experience with scrum, there were some disagreements. Because scrum is very flexible so members have used it differently? If we added extreme programming after a while we have to say why here. 

OMFORMULERES: Each team member spent a significant amount of time getting up to date with the Android platform and the frontend architecture of Android applications. In retrospect, more time should have been spent getting all group members up to date and practicing Android programming together in the beginning of the project. One of the team members had some experience with Android before and ended up spending a lot of time teaching and explaining to all of the other team members. If this had been organized in a way, for instance by holding a course in the beginning, some of the time spent on this could have been saved. 

\subsection{Technical choices}
The team agreed on using android studio from the beginning, after discussing wether to use android studio or eclipse with an android plugin. In the beginning there were some problems with Android Studio. Some team members had trouble actually running the application. There was a problem with Android Studio not finding the correct SDK. (<-IS THIS CORRECT?) This took some time to solve, but after it was solved the team had no more trouble with is. However, since Android Studio is a relatively new IDE, is still has some start trouble and updates comes out regularly. This meant that all of the group members had to use at least two or three minutes every time a new update came out. 

We changed the architecture during the process, we should write about that and why here, do we think we chose the best one? We chose to create a provider, do we feel it was worth all the extra time it took? 

\section{Project management}
SECTION NOT FINISHED. As mentioned earlier, the team chose scrum. Yodiz, we now wish we had chose another scrum tool. After a while we added a person responsible for some serving on our work days. Also responsible for making sure we took brakes. 
The team introduced punishments for being to late for meetings and not doing all of your assignments. This was used on a team building with some food. Did this work optimally?
\subsection{Working with the customer}
SECTION NOT FINISHED. The team tried to have meetings with the customer once a week. This worked well and the team felt that it was a good thing that the customer participated to such an extent. Write something about the problems with the customer saying he is going to do something but did not and how we solved the problems around this?

\subsection{Team organization}
SECTION NOT FINISHED.
In the beginning of the project, the team distributed roles with different responsibilities. A project leader, a deputy project leader, a scrum master, a development responsible, a test responsible and a report responsible. Almost halfway through the project it became clear that the scrum master was also the one with the most Android experience. This resulted in a lot of extra work on the scrum master, while the deputy project leader had almost no work at all. Therefore, the team reflected over the project roles and the distribution and this resulted in a change of roles. The deputy project leader became the scrum master to distribute the resources in the best possible way. After this change the teams best Android resource could focus entirely on developing and helping others. The team was very satisfied with this decision and the resource distribution worked great after the change in roles. 

Was the responsibilities of the roles good?

\chapter{Retrospect}
In this chapter, the objective is to evaluate all of the choices the team has made during this course. This includes the time spent, the entire development process - from choosing IDEs to testing the system and the project management. 

\section{Time spent and resource use}
SECTION NOT FINISHED. Here we are to write about what we think about following the wbs to structure our time. Was all the time spent with the supervisor and the customer optimal? Did we need all the resources given to us? Sudent assistant, group meetings with the class. Did we get the most out of our own group meetings or could we have done something different?
In the beginning, the team found the supervisors role somewhat confusing. After one or two meeting, and explicit asking the supervisor it became more clear to us that the supervisor was an overall support with focus on our report. 

\section{Development process}
SECTION NOT FINISHED. For this process, the team chose to use scrum together with extreme programming. (Did we add extreme programming after a little while? Should this be mentioned?) Even though all of the team members have previous experience with scrum, there were some disagreements. Because scrum is very flexible so members have used it differently? If we added extreme programming after a while we have to say why here. 
\subsection{Technical choices}
The team agreed on using android studio from the beginning, after discussing wether to use android studio or eclipse with an android plugin. 
We changed the architecture during the process, we should write about that and why here, do we think we chose the best one? We chose to create a provider, do we feel it was worth all the extra time it took? 

\section{Project management}
As mentioned earlier, the team chose scrum. Yodiz, we now wish we had chose another scrum tool. After a while we added a person responsible for some serving on our work days. Also responsible for making sure we took brakes. 
The team introduced punishments for being to late for meetings and not doing all of your assignments. This was used on a team building with some food. Did this work optimally?
\subsection{Working with the customer}
The team tried to have meetings with the customer once a week. This worked well and the team felt that it was a good thing that the customer participated to such an extent. Write something about the problems with the customer saying he is going to do something but did not and how we solved the problems around this?

\subsection{Team organization}
How do we feel the roles worked? We reordered the roles during the project, did this work?

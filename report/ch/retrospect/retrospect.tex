\chapter{Retrospect}
This chapter serves as an evaluation of the project and process as whole. It aims to summarize major decisions that were made, the impact of the decisions, and discussion around whether they should have been made differently. Everything from hours spent on the project, to the choice of IDE, to testing of the system will be evaluated.

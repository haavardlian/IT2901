In the very beginning of the project, the team looked into the possibility of getting live data directly from devices. This required some technical equipment for collecting and transmitting the usage of a device. The team were not able to find any cheap and easy way of doing this, so the idea was left. The concept was that the app should get live data directly form all of the devices in a house. It already exists hardware solutions that measures usage per device, but not that transmits that data wirelessly or via Bluetooth. If a hardware device doing both of these things is found, it is possible to modify Wattitude to get data from the hardware device. The next step would be that the devices transmits their energy usage directly by for instance Bluetooth.

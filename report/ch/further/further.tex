\chapter{Further development}
\label{sec:further}
The objective of this chapter is to describe how the team envisions further development of the system. Firstly, software improvements to improve Wattitude will be examined as well as how these improvements might be implemented. This involves functionality left out due to time constraints, and features that need improvements. 

Then, all new concepts the team have discussed during the project, but not have implemented in to the app are discussed. This includes how the team envisions functionality for measuring power production and methods for including gamification into the app. 

Lastly, some insight into hardware solutions needed to get live data from devices in the users house will be provided.

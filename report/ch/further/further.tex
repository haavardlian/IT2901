\section{Hardware solution (ANNET NAVN?)}
In the very beginning of the project, the team looked into the possiblity of getting live data directly from the users' devices. This required some technical equipment for collecting and transmitting the usage of a device. The team were not able to find any cheap and easy way of doing this, so the idea was abandoned. The concept was that the application should get live data directly form all of the devices in a house. It already exists devices that measures usage per device, but not that transmits that data wirelessly or via bluetooth. If a hardware device doing both of these things is found, it is possible to modify Wattitude to get data from the hardware device.

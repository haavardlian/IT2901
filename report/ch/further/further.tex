\chapter{Further development}
\label{sec:further}

The objective of this chapter is to describe all ideas the team came up with, but for some reason could not implement into the app. This could be time constraints or lack of hardware. \todo{This chapter is included to make it easier for other who wants to continue developing Wattitude.}

Firstly, software improvements and how to improve Wattitude is discussed. This involves functionality left out due to time constrictions, and features that need improvements. 

Then, all new concepts the team have discussed during the project, but not have implemented in to the app is discussed. This includes how the team envisions functionality for measuring power producution and methods for including gamification into the app. 

Lastly, the hardware solution needed to get live data from devices in your house is discussed. 

%\todo{Mention that the app should have technical documentation is a customer requirement in further %development? <- What is this?}

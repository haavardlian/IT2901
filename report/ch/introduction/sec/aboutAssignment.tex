\section{About the assignment}

Our project is a part of an ongoing research program, CoSSMic~\cite{cossmic}, focusing on how to store renewable energy in private households. 
The idea is that entire neighborhoods should be able to benefit from the excess energy produced by other households in the neighborhood. 
The research program aims to develop the tools needed for this sharing of energy. 

The objective of the project was to create an Android application, making it possible for the user to monitor his\footnote{This report will use the term ''his'' to refer to ''his/her'' and ''he'' to refer to ''he/she''} 
energy usage and energy production. 

There are already a couple of similar applications on the market, and some products with complete systems to measure and control users' energy consumption. 
What all of these solutions have in common is that they are either expensive, or they do not provide all the functionality that the customer wanted to have in a finished product. 
None of the other solutions the team researched provide support for measuring the users' energy production, and likewise none of them allow for social integration. These solutions are further explained in section~\ref{sec:altsolution}.

The customer had a very clear idea of the concepts that should be included in the application, but not much thought on the specifics. The customer provided the team with a figure showing the important concepts, and from that the was to write a specification that could be adjusted in cooperation with the customer. This process is described further in section~\ref{sec:obtainingreq}.

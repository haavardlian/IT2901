\section{About the assignment}

The project is a part of an ongoing research program, CoSSMic~\cite{cossmic}, which focuses on storage of renewable energy in private households. 
The idea is that entire neighborhoods should be able to benefit from the excess energy produced by other households in their neighborhood. 
The research program aims to develop the tools needed for sharing energy. 

The project's objective was to create an Android \gls{app}, making it possible for the user to monitor his\footnote{This report will use the term ''his'' to refer to ''his/her'' and ''he'' to refer to ''he/she''} 
energy usage and energy production. 

Similar apps exist on the market, some with complete systems to measure and control users' energy consumption. What they have in common is that they are either expensive, or do not provide all desired functionality. More on this may be found in section~\ref{sec:altsolution}.
%None of the other solutions the team researched provide support for measuring the users' energy production, and likewise none of them allow for social integration. These solutions are further explained in section~\ref{sec:altsolution}.

The customer had a clear idea on the concepts to include in the app, but no specific requirements. The customer provided a figure illustrating the most important concepts, which was used as a foundation when the requirements were specified,
%Based on this figure the team was to write a specification that could be adjusted in conjunction with the customer. 
as described in section~\ref{sec:obtainingreq}.

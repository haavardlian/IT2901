\section{Available resources}

During the project scope, the team had several available resources, including work hours, our institute supervisor and the customer representative. In order to cope with these resources, deadlines were set for important events and milestones so that the team would be better able to create a satisfying product.


\subsection{Available hours}

The assignment and team members were assigned on January 20. The initial meeting with the customer took place January 24, where the assignment was presented and discussed. Oral presentation of the project was performed March 19 and the final deadline for submission of the project was set to May 30. The team set the deadline for new specifications from the customer that would result in major changes to the software, to March 21, due to time restrictions.

Each sprint had a duration of two weeks, excluding the period from April 4 to April 21, when the entire group left for a school field trip to China.

Table~\ref{tab:availHours} lists the project's available hours and is based on that all team members spends at least twenty hours on the project every week.

To compensate for the days the team missed because of the school field trip mentioned above, the team decided to increase the amount of work hours from 20 hours to 25 hours as of sprint 2 to and including sprint 8.

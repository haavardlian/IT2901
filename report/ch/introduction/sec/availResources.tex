\section{Available resources}
To make the most of the time usage in the project, the team decided to break down the project scope into several parts. This was done to better specify detailed tasks within a specific time frame and hence assign each part with their own deadline and goals.

Table~\ref{tab:milestones} lists the deadlines for important deliveries and events in the project, while table~\ref{tab:availHours} lists the project's available hours and is based on that all team members spends at least twenty hours on the project every week. 

In the subsequent sections, we have provided contact information to our supervisor and the customer representative.

\subsection{Important deliveries and events}
The milestones are deliveries set by the institute, while the events are deadlines the team itself has set.

\subsection{Available hours}
Each sprint had a duration of two weeks, excluding the period from April 4 to April 21, when the entire group left for a school field trip to China.

To compensate for the days the team missed because of the school field trip mentioned above, the team decided to increase the amount of work hours from 20 hours to 25 hours as of sprint 2 to and including sprint 8.

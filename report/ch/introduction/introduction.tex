\section{About the assignment}
\subsection{Current situation}
Our project is a part of a ongoing research program, CoSSMic~\cite{cossmic}, focusing on how to store renewable energy in private households. The idea is that entire neighborhoods should be able to benefit from the excess energy produced by other households in the neighborhood. The research program aims to develop the tools needed for this sharing of energy. 

\todo[inline]{The task of our project is to make an Android application, making it possible to get information about a user's energy usage and energy production.} There are already a couple of similar applications on the market, and some products with entire system setups to measure and control users' energy consumption. \todo[inline]{Common for all of these solutions are that they are either expensive, or they do not provide all the functionality the team want to have in the project application.} None of the other solutions provide support for measuring the user's energy production. These solutions are further explained in section~\ref{sec:altsolution}.

\subsection{What the customer wants}
The specifications provided by the customer are open for interpretation. The customer wants the team to come up with an application that is user friendly and simple, so that anyone can measure their energy consumption, preferably per device, and share it with their friends and compete with each other to save and/or produce the most energy. In order to do this, the team needs a hardware device to measure the energy consumption for each device. Optimally, the device transmits the signal either via Wifi, Bluetooth, or another form of wireless communication protocol. \todo[inline]{The customer does not expect the team to make the hardware for the application if we do not find any device that is compatible with the team's solution, and that is within a reasonable price range.}

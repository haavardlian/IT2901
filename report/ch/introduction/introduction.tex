\section{About the assignment}
\subsection{Current situation (AS IS)}
Our project is a part of a ongoing research program \cite{cossmic}, focusing on how to store renewable energy in private households, so that entire neighborhoods can benefit from it if one household is producing more than they need. The research program aims to develop the tools needed for this sharing of energy. The task of our project is to make an Android application, making it possible to get information about a user's energy usage and energy production. There is already a couple of similar applications on the market, and some products with entire system setups to measure and control users energy consumption. Common for all of these solutions are that they either are expensive, or they do not provide all the functionality the team want to have in the project application. None of the other solutions provide support for measuring the users' energy production. These solutions are further explained in ~\ref{sec:altsolution}

\subsection{What they want (TO BE)}
The specifications provided by the customer are open for interpretation. (<--MÃ¥ finne en annen formulering her.) They want us to come up with something simple, so that anyone can measure their energy consumption, preferably per device, and share it with their friends and compete with each other to save and/or produce the most energy. To do this the team needs a hardware device to measure the energy usage on each device. Optimally the device transmits the signal either via Wifi, bluetooth, or something similar. The customer do not expect us to make this device if we do not find anything appropriate for the team's purposes, and in a reasonable price range.

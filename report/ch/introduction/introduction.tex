\section{About the assignment}
\subsection{Current situation (AS IS)}
Our project is a part of a reasearch program going on \cite{cossmic}, focusing on how to store renewable energy in private houses, so that entire neighbourhoods can benefit from it if one household is producing more than they need. The research program aims to develop the tools needed for this sharing of energy. The task of our project is to make an androidapp, making it possible to get information about your energy usage and your energy production. There is already a couple of similar apps on the marked, and some products with entire system setups to measure and control your energy consuption. Common for all of them are that they either are expensive, or they do not provide all the functionality we want. None of them provide support for measuring your energy production.  

\subsection{What they want (TO BE)}
The specifications from the customer are very open. (<--Må finne en annen formulering her.) They want us to come up with something simple, so that anyone can measure their energy consuption, preferably per device, and share it with friends and compete with each other to save and/or produce the most energy. To do this we need an hardware device to measure the energy use on each device and optimally we want the device to transmit the signal either via wifi or bluetooth, or somthing similar. The customer do not expect us to make this device if we don’t find anything appropriate for us use, and in a good price range.

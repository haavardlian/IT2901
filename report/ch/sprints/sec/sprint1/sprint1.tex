\subsection{Election process of Scrum tools}
\label{sec:scrumtools}
The team started by researching what tools that satisfied our scrum criterias \ref{sec:sprintplanning}. Some of the tools that was suggested was iceScrum~\cite{icescrum}, yodiz~\cite{yodiz}, scrumdo and jira.

The team has previous experience with iceScrum. After a discussion, the team came to the conclusion
that iceScrum was not to be used again and that an alternative was needed. The reason for this is that iceScrum must be deployed on a server, and it's restrictive in how to use it.
Some of the tools was professional but optimized for enterprise use. Others lacked professionalism.
After having reviewed the different cloud based Scrum tools, the team ended up with Yodiz as the best alternative. The winning arguments was a
good sprint board, ease of use, mostly positive reviews and pricing.

The project will be divided into epics, user stories and tasks. Epics are user stories that are more general,
and demand at least twelve hours of work to complete. Each epic consists
of all the user stories that explain the usage of the epic in more detail.
The user stories will have time estimates discussed during sprint planning meetings.
The sprint backlog will consist of the user stories that the team has decided to handle.

A user story is given smaller tasks that are the different technical aspects of the story that needs to be done.

During a sprint the progress is handled in a Scrum board. The Scrum board has four columns. One for the user stories, new tasks, tasks in progress, and completed tasks.
All the tasks for the user story are in the new column and on the same row as it's user story, then dragged appropriately to the correct column during the sprint, and updated with time usage.

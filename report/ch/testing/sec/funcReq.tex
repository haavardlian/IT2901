\section{Testing functional requirements}
\label{sec:funcTest}
Functional testing are tests that control the functionality of the software. Internal classes and methods is tested indirectly. This is a type of Black Box Testing~\cite{blackbox}. This is done by feeding the application data and check that it responds the way it should. It is common to to give the application proper data to check that it is handled correctly and to give it incorrect data to check if the application fails gracefully and does not break the application. If a test fails there is a bug in the code that needs to be corrected.

To test a system the following steps are required.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify what features/functionality to test
\item Specify input to the system
\item Specify expected output from the system
\item Execute
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Test table}
This table has some example of functional test that the project should support.

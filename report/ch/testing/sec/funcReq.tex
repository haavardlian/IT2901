\section{Testing functional requirements}
\label{sec:funcTest}
Functional testing is tests that control the functionality of the software. Internal classes and methods are tested indirectly. This is a type of Black Box Testing~\cite{blackbox}. This is done by feeding the application data and check that it responds the way it should. It is common to to give the application proper data to check that it is handled correctly and to give it incorrect data to make sure the application fails gracefully and does not crash. If a test fails there is a bug in the code that needs to be corrected.

To test a system the following steps are required.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify what features/functionality to test
\item Specify input to the system
\item Specify expected output from the system
\item Execute
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Test table}
The table \ref{tab:testTable} presents a list of functionality that should be tested thoroughly every iteration of the application. Because of the lack of automatic unit testing the functionality had to be tested manually to be sure new functionality and bug fixes did not break anything new in the application.

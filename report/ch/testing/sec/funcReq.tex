\section{Testing functional requirements}
\label{sec:funcTest}
Functional tests are tests that inspect the functionality of the software. This is a type of black-box testing~\cite{blackbox}, which is a software testing method that examines app functionality without exploring the app's internal structures. This is done by feeding the app data and checking that it responds properly. The given input is either a) correct data, where it is checked that the data is handled correctly, or b) incorrect data, to make sure the app fails gracefully and does not crash. To test a system the following steps are required:\\\\
1. Identify what features or functionality to test\\
2. Specify input to the system\\
3. Specify expected output from the system\\
4. Execute

\subsection{Test table}
Table \ref{tab:testTable} presents a list of functionality that should be tested thoroughly in every iteration of the application if applicable. This table is a subset of table~\ref{tab:funcReq} with some of the text paraphrased. Because of the lack of automatic unit testing, the functionality had to be tested manually in order to be sure that new functionality and bug fixes did not break any existing functionality.

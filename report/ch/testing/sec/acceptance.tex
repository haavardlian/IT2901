\section{Acceptance testing}
In addition to the functional testing, the customer also participated in the testing process. This was done because the customer had insight in his requests and could provide valuable third party insight. The customer also delivered the app to third party users so the app could be tested in real life circumstances.

Acceptance testing was done throughout the development process in the sprint end meetings with the customer, and was also a part of the final testing. At the end of the development process the customer met with the team to review the finished product. The customer previewed the app while the team answered questions from the customer. In the end the customer was satisfied with the product and asked that the team make the documentation available on the GitHub repository to simplify further development.

\subsection{Iterative customer testing}
From the very beginning of the design phase, the customer met with the team at least once per sprint, and often twice. From approving and giving feedback on paper prototypes to comments on the final design, the customer was tightly integrated to the development of the app. Each or every other Friday, the customer would give his thoughts on the the current development prototype of the app. Comments on earlier request and further thoughts were noted and taken into consideration when the team had sprint start up meetings.

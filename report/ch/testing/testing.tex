\chapter{Testing}

In order to deliver a complete and functional product to the customer, it is paramount to make sure the system is regularly tested during development. 
By running tests we increase system stability and robustness, which in turn increases the usability of the product. 

There are several approaches when it comes to testing of software systems. The team looked into unit testing and functional testing. 
Unit testing is a form of white box testing and when unit testing Java based applications it is very common to use JUnit~\cite{junit}. 
With JUnit you can easily test every function on the program. The team decided that functional testing made the most sense for this project, this approach is described in its own section.

At the end of each sprint tests will be run to see if the applications meets the specifications. Tests will also be run at the end of the development process. 
In addition to this the customer will also participate in the testing, and deliver the application to third-party users so the application will be tested by users as well.

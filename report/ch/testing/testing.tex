\chapter{Testing}

In order to deliver a complete and functional product to the customer, it is paramount to make sure the system is regularly tested during development. 
By running tests we increase system stability and robustness, which in turn increases the usability of the product. 

There are several approaches when it comes to testing of software systems. The team looked into both \gls{unit} and functional testing. Unit testing is a method for testing small parts of a program, often individual functions, independent of the rest of the program. Functional testing is when you test functionality manually. The team decided to use functional testing on the android application because it is heavily focused on a user interface, and unit tests on the server, to make sure all the server functionality is up and running.

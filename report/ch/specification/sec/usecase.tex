\section{Use cases}
To get some overview of what functionality the team pictured in the finished application \glspl{use case} for the system was created. These was changed a bit after the requirements was changed and this is the final version. Functionality that was initially included in the requirements, but left out when it became clear to the group that there would not be enough time is discussed in chapter~\ref{sec:further}, further development.


An overview of all the textual usecases, see Appendix~\ref{sec:textUseCase}

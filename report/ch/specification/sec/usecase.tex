\section{Use cases}
To get some overview of what functionality the team pictured in the finished app \glspl{use case} for the system were created. Below, in figure~\ref{fig:usecase}, is a graphical use case of the final version of the system.

Functionality that was initially included in the requirements, but left out when it became clear to the group that there would not be enough time is discussed in chapter~\ref{sec:further}, further development. For an overview of all the textual usecases, see Appendix~\ref{sec:textUseCase} \newline

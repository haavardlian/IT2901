\chapter{Project Management}

The object of this chapter is to provide information about the project management and give an overview of the project's process. 

The first part of the chapter consists of a description of which development methods the team used and why they were chosen. The second part consists of an overview of the project time allocation, including a work breakdown structure, which gives an overview of which tasks the project consists of, and a Gantt diagram, which briefly explains the time line of the project's progress. The last part consists of a risk analysis and a thorough explanation on the thought behind each of them.

\section{Risk analysis}

\label{sec:risk}
As part of the project planning, the team outlined potential risks to the progress of the project. A risk is defined as an unwanted event that may have a negative effect on the process. The team acknowledged the possibility of challenges and issues that might arise during the project, such as technical problems, human errors or personal problems. These risks might apply to both individuals and the entire team. Effects of these problems include delays, conflicts and anything that might slow down the progress, and ultimately lead to failure to meet deadlines. 

In table~\ref{tab:risktable} elements considered as risks in the project is evaluated. The probability of an event actually occurring (P) and the effect it would have on the project (E) is measured on a scale from 1 to 9. Importance (I) is the product of probability and effect. The table is sorted from high to low importance.

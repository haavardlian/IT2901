\section{Risk analysis}

\label{sec:risk}
As part of our project planning, we outlined potential risks to the progress of our project. A risk is defined as an unwanted event that has a negative affect on the process. We acknowledged the possibility of challenges and problems that might arise during the project, such as technical problems, human errors or personal problems. These are risks that might apply to both individuals and the entire team. Effects of these problems include delays, conflicts and anything that might slow down the progress, and ultimately lead to failure to meet deadlines. 

The risk elements are sorted by their importance. Importance is calculated with two factors in mind; the calculated probability of the event actually occurring and the effect the event will have on the project. 

In the table given below, we analyze the elements we consider risks to our project. Likelihood (L) and effect (E) is measured on a scale from 1 to 9. For likelihood, a 9 is very likely and a 1 is very unlikely. For effect, a 9 is devastating and a 1 is very little effect. The table is sorted from high to low importance (I). Importance is the product of probability and effect.

\section{Risk analysis}

\label{sec:risk}
As part of our project planning, we outlined potential risks to the progress of our project. A risk is defined as an unwanted event that has a negative effect on the process. We acknowledged the possibility of challenges and issues that might arise during the project, such as technical problems, human errors or personal problems. These are risks that might apply to both individuals and the entire team. Effects of these problems include delays, conflicts and anything that might slow down the progress, and ultimately lead to failure to meet deadlines. 

In table~\ref{tab:risktable} we analyze the elements we considered as risks in our project. The probability of an event actually occurring (P) and the effect it would have on the project (E) is measured on a scale from 1 to 9. Importance is the product of probability and effect. The table is sorted from high to low importance (I).

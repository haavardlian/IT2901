\subsection{Sprint 3}
\subsubsection{Sprint start}
This sprint was dedicated to work on the customers wishes for the application. A customer meeting had been done on the last day of last sprint. The meeting gave us a lot of good feedback about what to focus on.
What the team experienced had experienced previously was that it was hard to work on writing the application for the parts that was not well prototyped.
The decision thus, was to focus on having detailed, well thought prototypes, that would satisfy the customers feedback. 

For the parts of the application that we don't have time to implement, there will be a textual description.

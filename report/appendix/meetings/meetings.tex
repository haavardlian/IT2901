\section{Meetings with supervisor}
The team had meetings with the supervisor every other week throughout the project, except for the period when the team was absent for the school trip to China. After this period, the semester was ended, and all meetings after this point was initiated exclusively by the team. All these meetings were held in the break room area outside the supervisor's office.

\section{Meetings with customer}
These meetings were held in the room on NTNU that was provided by the subject's administration. Initially, they were held every week, until the customer said he did not feel it was necessary to have these meetings that often. This was later withdrawn, and we went back to our original agreement.

\section{Introduction}
The team is currently working on sprint \#7. What mostly remains is adding some refinements to the product and ensure that we deliver both a satisfactory product and documentation of the creation process. During sprint 6 we focused on assembling and integrate the different parts of the code and replace dummy data with actual feed from Facebook and the server. Some of time was also used to restructure and review the content in the final report.


\section{Progress summary}
\subsection*{Beate}
During this sprint, I've mainly worked with the comparison functionality and layout. A lot of time were spent on solutions that were later restructured or removed, especially when replacing dummy data, such as actual Facebook profile pictures and charts in stead of pictures. I also set up the layout for the home-tab. I addition, I've spent some time reviewing the report and identified tasks that needs to be done to complete a satisfactory report.
